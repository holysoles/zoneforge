## About

Zone files are a commonly supported standard for serving [authoritative DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server#Authoritative_name_server) zone records, such as in [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/), [NSD](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/nsd), and [CoreDNS's file plugin](https://coredns.io/plugins/file/). While those DNS server implementations are highly performant and lightweight, they don't provide a user-friendly way to manage their zone's records.

ZoneForge simplifies the *management* of RFC1035/BIND-style DNS zone files by providing an intuitive web-based interface and REST API, instead of re-inventing an entire DNS server. This project is ideal for administrators who require:
- A centralized, user-friendly tool to manage DNS records.
- Robust REST API.
- Deployment flexibility for various environments.

## Migrating Existing DNS to a Zone File

For each domain that a given DNS server is authorative for:

1. First ensure that the zone is enabled for Zone transfer. For Windows DNS, this can be found by right-clicking the Zone -> Properties -> Zone Transfers.

2. Install `dig` on a unix-like system

3. Find the name servers if necessary: `dig example.com -t ns`

4. Initiate the Zone Transfer: `dig axfr example.com @dns.example.com | grep -E -v '^;' > db.example.com`

5. The file `db.example.com` should now contain a RFC1035-compatible zone file.
